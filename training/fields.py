She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as "John". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went. She was, mercifully, unharmed.18. Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o\'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L\'s room at the nurses\' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.19. Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.20. Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses\' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: "You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o\'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away.

It is further argued that the judge was wrong to reject a submission that there had been an element of provocation, which provided some mitigation for the offences of violence. In this regard, counsel pointed to evidence that there had been an incident earlier that day in which Kudriasov had been injured. They argued, in the alternative, in their respective written grounds, that the judge should have found some mitigation in evidence suggesting that there may have been some kind of drugs background to the attack on Messrs Kaleckas and Likso.16. Turning to personal mitigation, both appellants submit that the judge, although he specifically referred in his sentencing remarks to the appellants' previous good character, or effective good character, failed to give sufficient weight to that aspect of the case. Counsel pray in aid that both appellants are hard-working men with family responsibilities, and that both have behaved well and made good use of their time in custody whilst on remand awaiting trial.17. Next, specific submissions are made on behalf of the appellant Apsitis to the effect that his inability to speak or read English will mean that time in custody will be harder for him than for most other prisoners. It is also submitted on his behalf that the judge should have given some weight to the fact that Apsitis had always admitted presence, and that at a plea and case management hearing he had admitted guilt of an offence of unlawful wounding.18. On behalf of the appellant Kudriasov, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to find that he may well have brought a golf club to the scene. It is, however, realistically acknowledged that, whether he did or not, he was part of a group who were collectively armed.19. For those various reasons counsel submit that the total sentences of 18 years' imprisonment were manifestly excessive in length.", 'was too long as a matter of totality', '31. In our view, the appropriate sentence for all three offenders after a trial, given their individual aggravating circumstances, was in the region of eight to eight and a half years. The sentences of two years six months and two years nine months were unduly lenient.

He reminded himself of the guideline that the sentence of three and a half years\' detention was already "below the suggested range". He then returned to address the fact, amply established, that none of the guidelines constitute straitjackets and that judges should have the courage to depart from guidelines where it was right to do so. Addressing the facts of the case he said:\n \n  \n  \n "The medical evidence shows that there was penetration, that there was ejaculation; but as I have thought about the case, the more incredible it seems to me to be that there could have been anything beginning to approach a normal act of intercourse on your part without her waking. By \'normal\' I do not of course include \'consensual\'. Whatever happened must have been very brief."\n \n 18. The judge then examined the guideline which suggests the approach to be taken by sentencing judges where there has been penetration other than by the penis. Having reflected on these matters and considered the offender\'s culpability he came to the conclusion that no real harm was caused and therefore, in accordance with section 143 and 153(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the shortest sentence possible must be passed and the sentence would therefore be one of two years\' detention.', "we conclude that the total here of two-and-a-half years' imprisonment after a trial simply did not reflect the serious features", 'at the lower end of seriousness.
